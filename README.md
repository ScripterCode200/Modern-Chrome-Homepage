# CoreMe Extension 3.0

> **Status**: Active Development  
> **Version**: 3.0.0 (Alpha)

## 🌌 Overview

**CoreMe** is a futuristic, high-performance personal dashboard designed to replace the standard browser new tab page. Inspired by sci-fi interfaces and "Reactor Core" aesthetics, it turns your start page into a fully functional Command Center.

It combines productivity tools (Todo, Focus Timer) with personal growth tracking (Skill Matrix) and system monitoring, all wrapped in a sleek, dark-mode UI with fluid animations.
